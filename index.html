<h1>COSC1078
Introduction to Information Technology
Assessment 1: My Profile
Sean Shlemoon (S3660535)</h1>
	
<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>My name is Sean Shlemoon and I am currently studying the bachelor’s degree of information technology. I was born and raised in Detroit Michigan and my background is of the Assyrian People. A few hobbies of mine are coding, learning about the history of different cultures, and playing video games. I have been trying to teach myself different coding languages and seeing how each one works best for different types of project applications. As far as what I do with my spare time, I try to put aside a few hours of the day towards a business idea that I could one day start a company with. I strive for an entrepreneurial approach towards the projects that I think about in hopes of being able to help change the world in any way I can.</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>A couple of interests of mine within the world of IT are software engineering and cybersecurity. With software engineering, I have always had a fascination about how our everyday software applications are functioning as well as communicating across a vast array of different machinery. It is apparent how much our world is shaped and dependent on various types of software that exist, as well as how much power there is in the hands of the software engineers that are active in today’s economy. So much of our world’s GPD is dependent on technology, and it would be an obvious pathway for individuals to pursue so they can be the ones to write the code and change how we interact with one another.
With cybersecurity, knowing and understanding how information is being stored and utilized, it has made me even more self-conscious and aware of the dangers of browsing online without some sort of protection. I have always been trying to be as safe and secure as anyone can while being online, and to understand how exactly data is accessed across an extensive array of different websites and databases is fascinating to me. In my opinion, cybersecurity is everything when it comes to technology. As the world turns more towards going online, it is imperative to enforce safety and security when having large amounts of traffic over bandwidth.
My interest in IT goes a while back, roughly when I was about 10 years old. I have always been interested in technology in general and, as the family’s “technician”, I was always the one that would setup the router for our Wi-Fi as well as the various computers we would get for each member of the family. I would constantly take apart almost every laptop and PC we would get just to know what each component is responsible for and how to put everything back together. I would then take the time to understand the operating software and know the different shortcuts to take for troubleshooting issues and what applications I can run.
The one singular event that I can think of that I would be able to credit with further fuelling the passion that I had for technology would be the movie “The Social Network”. Ever since I had seen it, it stayed with me and the idea of being able to create something and start a company through coding was an exhilarating concept for me that I hoped to emulate one day. The world of start-ups and innovation surrounding Silicon Valley is something that I also have a keen interest in, knowing that future technology would most likely come from there and to be a part of that hub is hopefully in the horizon.
In terms of what I intend to learn and take from my studies, hopefully it would provide me with a strong foundation of knowledge and understanding of the various technologies that exist in our world and to be able to add onto them or change them anyway we see fit. With RMIT, I was fortunate enough to choose a university that seemed to offer a lot of opportunities that can lead towards expanding the “on the job” experience that not many places are very adamant about. With the IT industry, experience is key and without it, not many places will accept applicants that only have the theory and no practical applications of their skills.</p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>What I consider to be my ideal job is a software engineer working at Google. I believe that being a software engineer alone can open up many opportunities and provide constant employment regardless of where you may work at. Google is one place that I regard highly due to the more than average required skill sets that you’ll need to have, and Google has been considered as one of the greatest and happiest workplaces in the world (Mirmotahari, PerkUp, 2022). (https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/84362558342865606-software-engineer/)

	This position is advertised as a software engineer role working at Google’s Sydney office, and it’s something that perfectly aligns with what type of job I am hoping to apply for. Working as a software engineer for Google is quite possibly one of the best positions to be in when considering that you’ll be working with the latest and greatest pieces of software and technology. It’s appealing to me because it is exactly what I am looking for when searching for the best software engineering position out in the market as it allows me to be able to have great and wonderful ideas that can be applicable towards helping the world as well as provide Google with different perspectives on how to tackle various problems that may come up.
	There are minimum and preferred qualifications that Google offers, minimum being a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or any related field and even any equivalent practical experiences, and preferred being as advanced as either a master’s degree or PHD in the similar fields mentioned for the minimum qualifications. In addition to having some knowledge about computer science, the job advertisement also mentions experience with two or more programming languages such as Java, C/C++, Python, JavaScript, etc. In the case of many companies, it appears that experience with writing out the code in whichever language is specified may seem to be as equal to or valued more than having a tertiary degree. Understanding how exactly to express the ideas presented in the programming language versus simply knowing the theory behind it may hold more weight when it comes to applying for these different types of software engineering roles across different businesses.
	On the topic of where I am currently when it comes to how relevant my own personal skills and qualifications are as well as what experience I do have, I can be frank and say that I do need to have much more work done. I am currently teaching myself Python and JavaScript as a starting point for me to fully understand how the languages are operating as well as knowing the correct and appropriate syntax when implementing my code. For me to further advance my knowledge and skillset, I will need to be putting in much more hours of hard work towards learning about each individual programming language. A plan that I have had in mind is looking to apply for a coding bootcamp. I believe that it would provide me with the right tools and experience necessary for me to be able to approach any job position without worrying about being underqualified for the role.</p>

<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<p>After having completed an online Myers-Briggs test, from 16 Personalities, it shows that my personality type is an architect INTJ-T. The results of an online learning style test from LifeTrain shows that I have an even distribution of the reflector, theorist, and pragmatist style of learning whilst the activist style of learning is a smaller piece of the pie chart. Finally, the results from the Big Five personality test from Truity shows that from the OCEAN acronym (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism), I scored highly within the openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness categories. In regards to what the results of each of these tests mean to me, I do feel that they show certain characteristics and traits within myself that could be used by employers to gauge whether or not I would be valuable to their team and business. While I personally don’t think that they are in any way accurate in representing the kind of person that I am, they are closer to reality and in understanding human nature to a degree. In any case, it seems that many people are influenced by these results and may change their behaviour to match the results in order to seem more appealing and approachable, similar to virtue signalling and broadcasting themselves as someone they are not.
Within the context of a team, I wouldn’t be surprised if the members in that group showed similar results when doing any sort of learning style tests. Like-minded people would naturally attach themselves to one another and this can be a benefit or a burden for the team when put to the task on any number of problems. Without having people think differently from you, it can force the perspective of the people into having tunnel vision. When considering these tests for forming teams I don’t necessarily oppose them but I would not have them be the foundation upon which teams are being decided. There are several different factors that need to be considered when forming a team that these online tests completely overlook. Meeting people in person is quite possibly the most important and most influential deciding factor on whether you may want to choose that individual and work with them in a team. The more personal approach allows you to really know what kind of person you’re meeting with.</p>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>For my project idea, I have decided to create a smartphone application designed to predominately display how shoes and other articles of clothing will look on you. It will be able to show all different types of shoes that you may choose all from an extensive online market and with the utilization of the camera on the phone, as well as use of an augmented reality software, in real time it will project what the shoe will look like alongside any customized outfit of your choosing in addition to the correct shoe size. You will also be able to have different types of profiles to choose from, such as seasonal outfits as well as various functions with family or friends.

	I chose to go with this project because of my own passion and appreciation for shoes and the shoe culture in general. In addition, there is also a real-world application for this that can be one of many solutions towards the issue of the amount of carbon dioxide that is deposited in the atmosphere as well as the impact online shopping and returns have negatively affected the environment. For example, Amazon being the leading online retailer of the world “routinely send a billion returned items to landfills each year in Europe alone” (Ivanova, 2020 CBS MoneyWatch). This project idea allows the user to be able to choose any shoe that they want without the worry about returning in case of a wrong size or style and potentially contributing towards the decimation of the planet.

	When it comes to what features will be available, upon opening the app it would display the main page and allow the user to choose from a number of options available. The UI would be very simple and minimalistic and would be subjected to change over time based on the decisions made from the user, such as the colour and overall theme of the user profile. There will be several sections dedicated towards different functions such as one for creating and customizing various types of outfits for whichever occasion you may have, implementing different outfit profiles such as summer, winter, birthday party, family function, etc., and the ability to save each profile and access them anytime, as well as which shoe works best with that outfit. They may pick whether or not they are looking to purchase a new pair of shoes which will redirect them towards the online market within the app. The online market will utilize a database to store all kinds of shoes that are in stock and allow the user to retrieve them and see which one they would like to purchase from the inventory. It will source these shoes from different online and retail outlets. The pricing would also be a value based on retail for each unique shoe. Then they will be able to open up the camera and scan their feet to be able to accurately measure and determine which size fits best for them. It will be stored within the app in order to ensure that it remains consistent with any purchase made. Not only can the app be scanned for shoes but also with any piece of clothing. The AR software would accurately scan whichever part of your body the article of clothing is pertaining to and would also make suggestions based on patterns picked up through the purchases made from other users who have a similar style to yourself. The patterns would be collected as a way to understand the shopping behaviour of the users and allow you to choose from a sampled collection of possible outfit combinations.

	For the tools and technologies necessary for a project like this to exist, the main hardware being utilized would be a smartphone. Using your smartphone allows you to use your camera to be able to scan your feet in order to find the right pair of shoes to wear and the processing power required for the app to run is found in most recently released smartphones. The software on the other hand would be using augmented reality as a way to show the product in a virtual representation superimposed over the user’s feet, or with any type of clothing for any part of the body.

	The required skills needed for working on this type of project would be understanding the necessary programming language as well as the essential software kit used for AR programs, such as Unity and knowing how to write software using C++/C# (Parekh, P., Patel, S., Patel, N. et al. Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmented reality in medicine, retail, and games. Vis. Comput. Ind. Biomed. Art 3, 21 (2020). When considering how feasible obtaining these skills are, putting aside the time towards learning the basic syntax of each language as well as how the Unity engine works for different types of platforms it is being implemented towards is a first step towards developing the skills vital for creating a project and bringing the idea to life.

	With a project idea like this, it has managed to address many different problems that exist in our world and provide a solution that is beneficial to all parties involved. For example, one problem mentioned before is the issue of how 11% of all online sales are returned back which have accrued to nearly $369 billion in lost sales, in particular with the US market (AprissRetail, Consumer Returns, 2018). With this application, the return policy could be limited to simply if the product is damaged or lost in shipping. Preference change won’t be a valid reason as the application would show the shoe or clothing in all angles, thus reducing the number of lost sales based on returns. Additionally, it is also known that online shopping has had a negative impact on the environment due to the amount of CO2 being released into the atmosphere from supply chain transportation as well as the amount of items being sent to landfills based on returns (Tian, X., Sarkis, J. Emission burden concerns for online shopping returns. Nat. Clim. Chang. 12, 2–3 (2022)). Since the user is viewing the product beforehand in a very realistic demonstration through AR, the impact on the environment would be reduced drastically due to the fact that the shoe, for example, is being shown at a correct size and fitting for your feet. As a result, the chance of returning is lower because of the fact that you are practically viewing the shoe as it were to be delivered in person.</p>
